Tips: For this project, i tried different methods, so there have several versions in the file. In the file, which contains all my methods for this project. There are:

1. Final_Version_with_outlierValue
2. Final_Version_without_outlierValue
3. 20features
4. Neural Network
5. PCA_with_missingvalue_Version
6. PCA_without_missingvalue_Version

In Prediction_result file, this contians all my results of prediction

And the version i showed in my powerpoint are:
1. Final_Version_with_outlierValue
2. PCA_with_missingvalue_Version
3. Neural Network

And train, test file are train dateset and test dataset which Kaggle give to me

Sample_submission is the sample of final result of prediction

And the powerpoint is the presentation powerpoint
